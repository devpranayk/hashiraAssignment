output for input1.json.

The given values were converted into decimal roots: 4, 7, and 12.
The polynomial was constructed step by step as (x - 4)(x - 7)(x - 12).

The expanded polynomial is:
1x^3 - 23x^2 + 160x^1 - 336

The list of coefficients, starting from constant term to highest degree, is:
[-336, 160, -23, 1]
