output for input2.json.

We were instructed to use the first k = 7 roots to form the polynomial.
Each of the roots was given in a different base, and they were converted to decimal numbers.
Since the roots are very large, the coefficients of the polynomial are also extremely large.

The polynomial was built by multiplying (x - root) for each of the seven chosen roots.
The program successfully expanded the polynomial using BigInteger to avoid overflow.

The exact coefficients are printed by the program when run with input2.json.
Due to their massive size, we are storing them as raw program output instead of writing them manually here.
